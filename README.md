# [Project 1: Data Science Prediction Stroke:](https://github.com/Anggytriputra/Anggy_Portofolio/tree/main/Project_1)
Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability. One in four people are in danger of stroke in their lifetime. Lifestyle risk factors for stroke include being overweight or obese, physical inactivity, tobacco use and alcohol abuse. Medical risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and a personal or family history of stroke or heart attack. An estimated 70% of strokes occur in low- and middle-income countries, which also account for 87% of stroke-related deaths and disability-adjusted life years.
