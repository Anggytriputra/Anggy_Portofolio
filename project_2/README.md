My final assignment during my contract period as a Data Scientist virtual internship at [id/x Partners](https://idxpartners.com/), the dataset provided contained projects from lending companies and was asked to build a model that can predict Credit Risk consisting of data on loans accepted and rejected.

First I want to say thank you to [RAKAMIN](https://www.rakamin.com/virtual-internship-experience) who has become a liaison.

# Credit Risk
A credit risk is risk of default on a debt that may arise from a borrower failing to make required payments. In the first resort, the risk is that of the lender and includes lost principal and interest, disruption to cash flows, and increased collection costs. The loss may be complete or partial. In an efficient market, higher levels of credit risk will be associated with higher borrowing costs. Because of this, measures of borrowing costs such as yield spreads can be used to infer credit risk levels based on assessments by market participants.
